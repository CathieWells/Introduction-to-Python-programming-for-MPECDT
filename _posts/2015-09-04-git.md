title:  "Version control with git"
---

Let's head over to [Software Carpentry](http://www.software-carpentry.org/) for a [lesson in version control](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).

The take-home messages from this lesson should be:

* Version control is essential to reproducible science
* Version control provides a safe and effective way:
  * to collaborate
  * to have data, code and documents on multiple computers
  * to back up your data to the cloud.

In addition to [GitHub](https://github.com/), you can also host git
repositories on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/). 

If you get sick of constantly typing your password into git, you might
choose to use ssh keys to avoid this problem. There are instructions
[for GitHub]( https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)
and
[for Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-ssh-for-git-728138079.html). Note
that you can (and should) use the same ssh key for both sites.

In your copious free time, you should also register for the
[GitHub student pack](https://education.github.com/pack), which will give you unlimited private repositories as
well as other goodies.
