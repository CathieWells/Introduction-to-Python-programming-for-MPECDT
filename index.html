<p>Welcome to the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Mathematics of
Planet Earth. The objective of this short course is to ensure that
everyone in the CDT cohort has the programming and computing skills
which are necessary for the core CDT modules and to start out as a
mathematics researcher.</p>

<p>In particular we will be covering two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of revision control software to manage and protect your
work as it develops.
</li>
<li>Scientific programming in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>We will start out with an introduction
to <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, a leading revision control
system. This introduction is provided
by <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org/">software
carpentry</a>, a programme which teaches computing skills to scientists.</p>

<p>The Python course is based on a course taught to geoscience students at Imperial College London. To get our hands on programming as early as possible, we'll start out using 
<a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">Jupyter Notebook</a>
which is a friendly "web-based interactive computational environment where you
can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a
single document". This will allow us to develop and execute our programs alongside the lecture notes, instead of having to switch between the two.</p>

<p>After a few days we'll switch to working with Python programs
written in files and using Python on the command line. This way of
using Python is the primary way that Python is used in the sort of
computational mathematics which is common in the Planet Earth
application domain.</p>
